Things left:

Client:
- Wallet icons
- fix initial sizes, layouts

Backend:
- Fix encryption
- Possibly provide metadata (wallet comment, statistics, etc)
- Ability to support different crypto backends
- Move KWallet::Entry to the backend library?

Integration:
- KHTML
- KIO
- KMail


Future ideas:
- Ability to hide entries and only show their values after clicking on an
  "expose" button.
- Configuration panel
	-> "Don't prompt when apps try to access an open wallet"
	-> "Don't launch wallet manager on wallet open"
	-> Crypto algorithm to use
	-> Random source
- File association of kwallet type to kwalletmanager
	-> requires support in kwalletd for opening URLs as wallets.  Tedious.
- Make it a kpart
