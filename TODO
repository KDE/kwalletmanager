Things left:

Client:
- Map editor can't handle multiline values

Backend:
- provide metadata (wallet comment, statistics, etc)
- test 64 bit, zSeries
- investigate timestamping
- import testcases
- races in kwalletd
- refactor the hashes to make it efficient
- first launch wizard
- write non-zero byte file to disk if it doesn't exist already

Integration:
- Cookie jar
- KIO
- KMail

Configuration:
	-> Implement idle timers
	-> Ability to configure the accept list for applications

Future ideas:
- File association of kwallet type to kwalletmanager
	-> requires support in kwalletd for opening URLs as wallets.  Tedious.
- Make it a kpart
