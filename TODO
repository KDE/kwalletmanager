Things left:

- Drag and drop of folders between wallets
- Add a generic "writeEntryType(name,value,type)" method to make the code
  more extensible
- File association of kwallet type to kwalletmanager
	-> requires support in kwalletd for opening URLs as wallets.  Tedious.
- Wallet icons
- fix initial sizes, layouts
- Fix HTML
- Bug: saved maps end up as binary type for some reason
