Things left:

Client:
- Wallet icons
- ability to list usage of wallets?
- Map editor is still buggy

Backend:
- allow unpassworded wallet?
- test compatibility:
	- 32 bit, 64 bit, zSeries
	- big endian, little endian
- fix blocking issues

Integration:
- KHTML
- KIO
- KMail


Future ideas:
- Ability to hide entries and only show their values after clicking on an
  "expose" button.
- Possibly provide metadata (wallet comment, statistics, etc)
- Configuration panel
	-> "Don't prompt when apps try to access an open wallet"
	-> "Don't launch wallet manager on wallet open"
	-> Leave wallet open when all apps are done with it
	-> Don't close kwalletmanager when all wallets are closed
	-> Crypto algorithm to use
	-> Random source
- File association of kwallet type to kwalletmanager
	-> requires support in kwalletd for opening URLs as wallets.  Tedious.
- Make it a kpart
