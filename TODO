Things left:

Client:
- Wallet icons
- Map editor can't handle multiline values

Backend:
- test 64 bit, zSeries
- fix blocking issues
- investigate timestamping
- Configuration panel
	-> Implement idle timers
	-> Implement wallet name settings

Integration:
- Cookie jar
- KHTML
- KIO
- KMail


Future ideas:
- Ability to hide entries and only show their values after clicking on an
  "expose" button.
- Possibly provide metadata (wallet comment, statistics, etc)
- Configurable crypto algorithm to use
- File association of kwallet type to kwalletmanager
	-> requires support in kwalletd for opening URLs as wallets.  Tedious.
- Make it a kpart
